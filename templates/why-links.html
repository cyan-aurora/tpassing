	<h1>Why we don't host images / why we ask you to submit links</h1>

	<p>The idea behind the security of this website (TODO) is that rather than
	protecting the images themselves (nearly impossible) we just protect their
	association with transgender / you / the internet. If you upload to imgur
	it'll only be accessible from here.</p>
