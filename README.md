# A fair, safe place to see how well you pass

[/r/transpassing](https://reddit.com/r/transpassing) is great and all, but it
has some flaws, mainly due to the fact that **it's really not well suited to
reddit**. The task of seeing how well you pass is a difficult, and important to
some, and /r/transpassing got the idea right: anonymous internet users are
probably the most honest. However, **some people don't want to publish pictures
of themselves to a trans website for the world to see**. Additionally, **votes
on /r/transpassing are based on how well you pass**. This is absurd and defeats
the purpose: viewers just see people who pass, who get lots of feedback, and
those who don't are left behind. Yes, there is /new. But no one uses it (except
me), and the first issue stands.

My answer: this (insert domain name here). This is a fair and safe place to see
how well you pass. (Based off the /r/transpassing tagline.) First, how is it
fair? Feedback is given to those who give feedback, not those who pass. Second,
how is it safe? Pictures are transient and unassociated with the website. The
picture itself it is impossible to prevent from being screenshotted. But my
idea was that if there's no relationship between the image and the website,
there's no real issue.
